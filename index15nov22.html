//we add images using the emmet img. We have the attributes src and alt. src attribute will tell us where we are looking for the image while alt attribute is used when we cant access the image
// to open from file system:src="A car.jpeg" and src="./A car jpeg" 
// to open from live server: src="/A car.jpeg"
// to open from both liver server and file system: src="A car.jpeg"
// two dots mean its outside the directory( mostly used in css) src="../A car.jpeg"

// To add images from the internet we use 
<img src="(copy and paste the link of the image )" alt=" youtube logo" />,, DISCLAIMER: The links are very long.
//copyright images from the internet can be accessed from: PIXABAY, PEXELS, GRATISOGRAPHY


//To adjust the size of an image
<img src="./Images/A car.jpeg" height="50" width="100" alt="" />
// If we use big images the loading time will be very slow


//NB: To make work easier and better accessibility,put all images in the same folder.
